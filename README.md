# Google Code Jams

This repository contains:

- My solutions with python code to the problems from the Google Code Jams
- Resources to learn and prepare the challenges
- A scrapper to download information from the languages used by the participants in the challenges

The goal is to improve my algorithmic skills and to see if python can be a competitive language.
The statistics so far so that the best competitors use mainly C++.
